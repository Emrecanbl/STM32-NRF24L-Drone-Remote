STM32-NRF24L Drone Remote
This project is a drone controller based on the NRF24L transceiver module and the STM32 G031 microcontroller. It is designed to provide a robust and efficient communication link for drone control applications.

Features
STM32 G031 Microcontroller: Utilizes the powerful and efficient STM32 G031 for processing.
NRF24L Transceiver: Ensures reliable wireless communication using SPI.
2.4GHz Connection: Operates on the 2.4GHz frequency band for long-range and interference-resistant communication.
Custom Protocol: Implements a custom protocol for communication between the controller and the drone.
Low Latency: Designed for real-time control with minimal latency.
Components
STM32 G031 Microcontroller
NRF24L Transceiver Module (connected via SPI)
Various peripheral components (buttons, joysticks, etc.)

Usage
Power on the controller:
Ensure the controller is powered and connected to the drone's receiver.

Pairing:
The controller will automatically attempt to pair with the drone's NRF24L receiver.

Control:
Use the joysticks and buttons to control the drone. The custom protocol ensures real-time communication and low latency control.

Custom Protocol
The communication protocol used in this project is designed to be lightweight and efficient. It includes error-checking and retransmission mechanisms to ensure reliable communication even in noisy environments.

Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: Ensure that the NRF24L modules on both the controller and the drone are powered and within range.
Latency Problems: Check for interference from other 2.4GHz devices and ensure that the code is optimized for real-time performance.
Compilation Errors: Ensure that all necessary libraries and dependencies are included in your project setup.
